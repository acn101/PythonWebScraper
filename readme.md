<h3>Python Link Scraper</h3>
<p>Thank you for viewing my web scraping application coded in Python with the use of BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium.</p>
<p>This is a small personal project I created to try my hand at Python and its many pip repositories.</p>
<p>main.py creates a simple text file with a list of links for a user specified website.</p>
<p>web.py creates a very basic html file that can be opened in a web browser to try and display all images of the users specified website.</p>
